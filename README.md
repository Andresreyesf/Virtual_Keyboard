# Brain_machine_interface_eyes_blinking
Virtual keyboard implemented in an Android mobile app, controlled by voluntary blinks detected with a Brain-Computer Interface(BCI) using the electroncephalography (EEG) device Mindwave Mobile 2. For the processing and classification of the EEG signal, we embedded a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network in the mobile app. This project was developed in Android Studio IDE.
